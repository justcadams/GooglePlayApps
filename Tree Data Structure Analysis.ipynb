    "# Project 3 - Tree Data Structure Analysis\n",

    "##  1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Project 3 requires students to analyze three simple data structures: the Splay Tree, Adelson-Velsky and Landis (AVL) Tree, and Binary Tree. The base class applications.h used in these data structures for this lab experiment can be found in the appendix. The Applications base class loads Google Play Store meta data from a .csv file available at https://www.kaggle.com. This file contains n=10,843 meta data objects, while the total number of applications available on Google Play Store is currently 2.8 million. So, this file is a small fraction (0.004\\%) of the total applications meta data stored on Google's servers. For the purposes of this lab experiment a small fraction of the Google Play Store applications meta data is enough to discover emergent properties within the three selected tree data structures.\n",

    "### Splay Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The Splay Tree data structure uses the property of localization to speed up recurrent search times. Given that the tree contains n objects, searching for an object in a Splay Tree in the best case scenario takes O(1), which is equivalent to finding the object at the root node. On average searching for an object in a Splay Tree takes O(log(n)), which is a depth approximately equal to log(n). Due to the fact that Splay Trees can become unbalanced, the worst case search time is O(n), where n is the number of objects. However, when the number of objects is large the chances of creating the worst case scenario decreases exponentially. The primary use case for a Splay Tree is when the same object is requested repeatedly, which means the search time for finding the object the first time is O(log(n)). If the next search is the same object, then the search time is O(1).\n",

    "### Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The first tree in this lab experiment is the Splay Tree, which uses the localization property to speed up recurrent search times. Given that the tree contains n objects, searching for an object in a Splay Tree in the best case scenario takes O(1), which is equivalent to finding the object at the root node (depth = 0). On average searching for an object in a Splay Tree takes O(log(n)), which is a depth approximately equal to log(n). Due to the fact that Splay Trees can become unbalanced, the worst case search time is O(n), where n is the number of objects. However, when the number of objects is large the chances of creating this worst case scenario decreases exponentially. The primary use case for a Splay Tree is when the same object is requested repeatedly, which means the search time for finding the object the first time is O(log(n)). If the next search is the same object, then the search time is O(1). The implementation for this data structure (SplayTree.h) was live coded by Professor Lisa Dion with suggestions from students in the Fall 2019, CS124 - Data Structures and Algorithms course at the University of Vermont.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Tree (Naive)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binary Tree is the simplest tree data structure. The only function it maintains is the Binary Search Tree ordering property, which reduces average search time to O(log(n)) for all trees of this class. In the best case the search time is O(1) and in the worst case O(n). Due to its simplicity, the Binary Tree is vulnerable to becoming unbalanced. However, probability theory states that the larger a binary tree is, the less vulnerable it is to the worst case O(n) run time.\n",

    "## 2. Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Store n custom data objects in a vector, where the number of objects n >= 1000.\n",
    "2. Create at least integers [0 - n-1] in sequence, in a random order, and repeats each integer 5 times [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 ... , n-2, n-1 , n-1 , n-1 , n-1, n-1]\n",
    "3. Store the objects in the trees mentioned above.\n",
    "4. Overload the <, >, and == operator for your custom class.\n",
    "5. Pass by reference the integer depth initialized at -1, increment the value upon entering the find function, increment the value upon traversing a new depth in the tree.\n",
    "6. Store the depth value and reset its value to -1.\n",
    "7. Search for objects from the original vector using the different integer lists generated\n",
    "8. Plot graphs of the search depths for each tree above. Do the properties of each data structure appear as emergent properties in the graphed data? Yes. See Analysis Section.\n",
    "9. Create three benign objects in your vector and describe what happens when searching for these objects.\n",
    "10. Cite all code and idea sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The following graphs collate 10843 node search requests for the Splay Tree (yellow), AVL Tree (green), and Splay Tree (Blue)."

    "### Splay Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The first emergent property is in the Splay Tree Duplicate Integer Sequence graph. Since the Splay Tree uses the property of localization to improve search time for recurrent requests, the duplicate integer sequence contains exactly 4/5 O(1) item requests at depth = 0. Many other requests are at values very near the top of the tree, where depth = 1, 2, 3, and 4. This localization property diminshes at a depth = 5. The remaining searches are scattered between depths of log(n) to 3 * log(n), where n = 10,843 objects. Thus, log(n) = 13.4. The worst case search depth for the Splay Tree in the integer sequence, random sequence, and prime sequence were at a depth = 34. This is the worst case search time for all of the Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AVL Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, dispersion is uniform across the integer and random sequence searches. Prime integers are sparse so it is important to note that for every tree data structure they demonstrate search times approaching worst case conditions without intentionally creating the worst case condition.\n",
    "The AVL Tree operates robustly on every integer sequence and it maintains a maximum depth 15≈log(n) due to the height ordering property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binary Tree demonstrates the value of using the Binary Tree ordering property as a data structure in that search depths in this lab experiment did not increase beyond 3 * log(n). However, the Binary Search Tree performs worse than the AVL Tree obtaining a maxmium search depth = 31. When compared to the Splay Trees worst case performance of depth = 34, the Binary Search Tree beats the Splay tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment demonstrates empirically the emergent mathematical properties of the three chosen tree data structures. The Splay Tree is best suited for problems involving information locality, and where available memory is at a premium. The AVL tree is best suited when memory and performance are a priority. The Binary Tree should not be used other than as an intellectual exercise to begin learning about Tree Data Structures. Like Bubble Sort some ideas are meant to teach best practices through object lessons.\n",
